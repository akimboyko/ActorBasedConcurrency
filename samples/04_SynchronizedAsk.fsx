// #Synchronized Return
// Actors are very suitable for long-running operations, like getting resources over a network.
//
// This example creates a Task with the ask function.
//
// In the actor we use 'sender <!' to return the value.
//
// #Asynchronous Return
// Asynchronous operations can provide better performance. 
// A Task in F# is very powerful, it can execute asynchronously.
// It can also set a in milliseconds to wait for the result of the computation 
// before raising a `TimeoutException`.
